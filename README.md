## Progressive Web Apps (PWA) 

A PWA is a collection of web techniques for building web applications with previous considerations in mind.
One popular technique is the service worker implementation of the Angular framwork to build a PWA that displays
the weather of a city using the OpenWeather API.

## Native Applications

Native applications are installed on the device of the suer, have access to its native resources, 
and can work seamlessly with any network. PWA applications stand between the two worlds of web and 
native acpplications and share characteristics from both.

## Converting Web Applications to PWA

Converting a web application into a PWA involves several steps and techniques. 
The most essential one is configuring a serrice worker. The service worker is a mechanism that is run on the web browser
and acts a s a proxy between the application and an external HTTP endpoint or other in-app resources such as JS and CSS 
files. The main job of the service worker is to intercept requests to those resources and act on them by providing a cached 
or live response. 

## Observables

Observables are based on the observer patter, which is the core of reactive functional programming. In the observer pattern,
multiple objects called observers can subscribe to an obserrvable and get notified about any changes to its state.
